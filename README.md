 SANA - A voice controllable virtual assistant based on python to automate your tasks and chat with.

Hi  , this is a  voice enabled virtual assistant made by me (Ankit Josh).
If ,you are wondering why is the name SANA, it is just one of my friend's name ^_^ 

I have clearly mentioned in the code which modules you need to install and what to do and how to do and what is its function.
Feel free to check out the code.

Use command pip install -r requirements.txt to install the modules all together.
Notice, some modules may still need to be downloaded and installed manually. I suggest you to check the code in such cases.

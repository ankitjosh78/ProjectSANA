# ProjectSANA
 SANA - A voice controllable virtual assistant based on python to automate your tasks and chat with.

Hi  , this is a  voice enabled virtual assistant made by me (Ankit Josh).
If ,you are wondering why is the name SANA, it is just one of my friend's name ^_^ 

#What can the assistant do ? Well , the features are listed below:

Whenever we run the assistant it should greet us depending upon the time of the day!

Now, the assistant should be able to do what we say.Example: If we say open google and search something, it should search for something

If we ask hey sana what is the time? It will tell the time

If we ask play music for me then it will play music from a specific directory.

If we ask for information about someone(celeb) it will fetch that from wikipedia.

It should be even able to search for a specific title said by us in youtube


#Working
Let us start discussing how the assistant will work. The idea is to use speech recognition to get the voice as a text.
Accordingly, we can perform various operation. Example: if we find the word "time" we can reply with the current time.
Refer to the code for better understanding.
